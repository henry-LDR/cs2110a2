1. How (if at all) did you use your unit tests as you were defining copyRange()?
We treated the tests like a running spec. After each small change (such as a bug fix), we ran the suite.
This allowed us to ensure that our method development stayed on the rails. We would use our unit tests
to ensure that only the dst array and not the src array changed and that invalid inputs return false
with no side effects.

2. Did you define the method all at once and then debug with the tests,
or did you break down your definition into multiple stages with intermittent testing?
We defined the method all at once and then debugged with tests because the method was
relatively straightforward to implement. As a result, we did not see the need to use the test cases
in our initial prototype o
